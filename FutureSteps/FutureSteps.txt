Moving towards biophysical design of the scenario
	1. Fix that little thing that happens, maybe by stiffening the springs inside the left cell
We want to reach equilibrium for both cells (x30 or x100
Use as condition for new simulation
	2. Make it so Mu and Rho (Fluid Viscosity and Fluid Mass Density) are same as reality
		Mu and Rho of Water
		Mu and time can be whatever unit I want (Currently corresponds to seconds?)
make cell bigger, like 5 times bigger
Mu should be fine as is
Rho want Rho = 10~-9 (right now 10^-4), but smaller means way more computational time
	10^-6 is limit for Jonathan's experience
Can you get it to run up to 0.1 seconds in a day or so?
Springs between cells should rest at 0.01 m (but try 0. 1)

Edit spring lengths/constants, beam assignments
Add beans too inside of vert.

1. Add beams
2. Check beams
3. Test with springs lengths
4. Test cleft sizes
5. Fix workflow
6. Write bash scripts
7. Clean up code and simulations, combine programs
8. 3d

dot anchor file, anchor everything but cleft (or target)

Remember google group
Replicate bellows
Shrink bounds of simulation, double layer cells

CHECK DIAGRAM
Make Line + Cell
Make D + D
Add second layer to cell
Add attaching cables
Reflection off side effect
Fluid spiral out not forward
Back to pull idea?
Adding double layers
